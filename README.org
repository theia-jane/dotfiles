#+TITLE: Configuration & Utilities
If you're going to a use a tool, you should use one that's specialized and fits you.

* Intro
Welcome! This is my configuration and utilities repository -- a home for the things that keep me productive and happy using a computer. Things are currently being transitioned from a hodge-podge of configuration files that I link everywhere to using a literate programming approach. The end state will /hopefully/ be that this repository reads a little more like a book.
* Dependencies
- =emacs=
* Usage
In order to get the various configuration files in place in the file system you need to to tangle them, which can be done by running
#+begin_src bash
./bin/config tangle
#+end_src
