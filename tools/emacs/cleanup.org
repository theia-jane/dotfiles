#+TITLE: Cleanup

* CANCELED Kill chemacs
Just kill it. I don't use it and it adds bloat
--
Future me says I want it :P
* DONE Kill elpm 
Figure out a better pattern for global packages. Might drag some of elpm into my config, but for now.. kill it.
* DONE Break out some of general.org
* DONE Cleanup doom/ [18/18]
** DONE Migrate doom/+bookmark.el to package
** DONE Migrate doom/+c.el to config

** DONE Migrate doom/+dsl.el to package
Not finished, so might just delete
