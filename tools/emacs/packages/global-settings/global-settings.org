* Cache directories
Cache directories are the home of those things which can be
deleted at anytime without an noticable difference to behavior
-- with the exception of performance.
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar user-cache-directory (expand-file-name "~/.cache/"))
(defvar emacs-cache-directory (concat user-cache-directory "emacs/"))
#+END_SRC

* Local directories
Local directories are the home of things that aren't quite
cache, but also aren't suitable for version control. If
these are deleted then some behavior / value / is lost, but
no core functionality should be broken or majorly changed.
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar user-local-directory (expand-file-name "~/.local/"))
(defvar emacs-local-directory (concat user-local-directory "emacs/"))
#+end_src

* Config directories
Config directories are the home of things that should be managed
by things that are under version control. Changes to anything
in these directories is expected to break things or at least
cause a change in behavior. 
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar user-config-directory (expand-file-name "~/.config/"))
(defvar emacs-config-directory (concat user-config-directory "emacs/"))
#+end_src
* Enable 'disabled' features
#+begin_src elisp

#+end_src
* Yes or no 
#+begin_src elisp
