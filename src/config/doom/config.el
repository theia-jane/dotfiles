;;; NOTE: (use-package!) should be used with care and specifically with defering keywords
;;;       Using use-package! without a deferring keyword (one of: :defer :after
;;;       :commands :defer-incrementally :after-call) will load the package
;;;       immediately. This can cause other packages to be pulled in and loaded,
;;;       which will compromise many of Doomâ€™s startup optimizations.
