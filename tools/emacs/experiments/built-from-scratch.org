#+TITLE: Built From Scratch
#+PROPERTY: header-args :dir ${HOME}/.local/emacs/configs/built-from-scratch

I find myself using a lot of features, but wanting fine grain control of them. That becomes more difficult in an ecosystem like doom or spacemacs. A lot of the configuration and package integration is certainly quite nice for reasons of sensible defaults to consistent 'feel' to the layout of things.

For me these packages / distributions have a lot of appeal for those reasons, but inevitably I but up against the edges or I get overwhelmed in all the goodies someone else has configured. It gives me the feeling of there being too many cooks in the kitchen. For now I am pretty happy with doom and I may always stay with doom, but I would like to experiment with my own "Built from scratch" configuration of emacs

* Usage
#+begin_src bash :dir ~/
d emacs-from-dir ~/.local/emacs/configs/built-from-scratch
#+end_src

* Config
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
(require 'experiment-bootstrap)
#+end_src
