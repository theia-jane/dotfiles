#+TITLE: Theme

This is to come. I'm going to make my own theme for cinnamon, gnome, gtk, etc.
And honestly, this might get pulled off into it's own repo. IDK.

* Tasks
** DONE Create files for normal theme layout
I copied the theme directory layout from Arc Dark -- not sure if I need / will add themes for every thing
** TODO Start with gtk-{2,3}.0
