# dotfiles

My configuration files (so the computer knows how I like it).

## other repos

Currently I have two other dotfiles repos. I was splitting them up, but
for configuration changes this is a pain to update. I'd rather just one
`git pull` than 3 or more, so I'm going with a mono-config-dotfile-repo.

Other dotfiles:

* [dotfiles-vim](https://github.com/waretyler/dotfiles-vim)
* [dotfiles-zsh](https://github.com/waretyler/dotfiles-zsh)
