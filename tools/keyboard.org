* Finding out key info
If you need to find out key info use =xev=, it will tell you which the keycode for the key you are pressing.
* Remap keys
I've tried to use xmodmap for this for a long time. Unfortunately it's not worked that well. Instead of that using =XKBOPTIONS= (see =man 7 xkeyboard-config=) for options. Specifically, I add the options I want to have them globally enabled in =/etc/default/keyboard=.

** Debug Notes
- To test out changes in the short term use =setxkbmap -option <option>=
- To see what options are set use =setxkbmap -query=

** Caps -> Hyper
To remaps caps to hyper for extra modifier. Use option:
=caps:hyper_mod=

By itself this will do nothing, but add the following to =/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/capslock=. This makes it a global change. Otherwise we need to use xmodmap to change which modifier hyper is

#+begin_src text
// This makes <CAPS> into a hyper, standalone modifier key
hidden partial modifier_keys
xkb_symbols "hyper_mod" {
    key <CAPS> { [ Hyper_L ], type[group1] = "ONE_LEVEL" };
    modifier_map Mod3 { <CAPS> };
};
#+end_src


** RAlt -> Compose
Set the right alt key to be the compose key allowing =<compose> " u= to generate =Ã¼=. Use option:

=compose:ralt=


* Keyboard Configuator
For my system76 keyboard it's nice to use the keyboard configurator, which will require some setup on a non-Pop_OS! system. For linux see [[file:appimage.org][AppImage notes]]. [[https://github.com/pop-os/keyboard-configurator/releases][Releases]] can be found here.
