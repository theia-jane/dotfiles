#+TITLE: Cleanup

* CANCELED Kill chemacs
Just kill it. I don't use it and it adds bloat
--
Future me says I want it :P
* DONE Kill elpm 
Figure out a better pattern for global packages. Might drag some of elpm into my config, but for now.. kill it.
* TODO Break out some of general.org
* TODO Cleanup doom/ [0/18]
** TODO Migrate doom/+bookmark.el to package
** TODO Migrate doom/+c.el to config
Prob need to install and require 'ob-C
** TODO Migrate doom/+color.el to config 
** TODO Migrate doom/+dsl.el to package
Not finished, so might just delete
** TODO Migrate doom/+eshell.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+eval-context.el to package
** TODO Migrate doom/+files.el to config
Looks like need to pull in doom/copy-this-file
** TODO Migrate doom/+helpful.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+key.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+magit.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+notes.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+org.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/packages.el to config
Might not want any of the packages, but some of them were interesting, so might circle back
** TODO Migrate doom/+pretty-stuff.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+scheme.el to config
** TODO Migrate doom/+svg.el to package
** TODO Migrate doom/+ui.el to config
I believe some of this has already been moved over, but would be good to verify
