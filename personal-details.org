/Note:/ This is a hack to get the table visible outside of this file. =org-babel-resolve-ref= pulls from library of babel, but library of babel does not ingest tables. One way to ingest this into the lob would be to add advice around =org-babel-lob-ingest= that maps all =#+name= properties and creates org source blocks that are resolvable (as I'm doing below)
